\chapter{Literature Review}
\label{cha:lit_review}

In this chapter, we explore the current state of the art and examine existing research efforts related to Non-verbal Communication and Physiological Data. We divide the research topics into the following areas, namely: the social impact of sharing physiological activity in human-human interactions, the appropriation of biosignals in creative practice and performance contexts, and methods for inferring emotional states from physiological data. After presenting a comprehensive collection of studies, we articulate a personal perspective, justifying the intersection of these topics and initiate the design principles that materialise in the research outcomes described in Chapters \ref{cha:Preliminary_Actions} and \ref{cha:case_studies} that following.

% \section{Social Signals}


\section{Communication and Connection}
\label{lit_review:biosignals_sharing}


In the pursuit for communication with embodied sensors, we can direct our interest to the topic of sharing biosignals or \textit{foreign live biofeedback} to support social interactions, where users are provided real-time feedback on another person's physiological state, as it is described in Ewa Lux et al.'s \cite{lux_live_2018} review article, listing 20 use-cases under this category. This includes a number of studies on sharing physiological signals (predominately heartbeats) between users to enhance remote presence. Such feelings of interpersonal connectedness can be accredited to a kind of anatomical transparency. Beyond that, however, it's not well understood on an emotional level the extent at which this information can be interpreted by a foreign body.

In \citeauthor{slovak_understanding_2012}'s study into sense-making with interpersonal biofeedback for heart rate, possible interpretations are classed as HR as information and HR as connection \cite{slovak_understanding_2012}. The article compares visual and aural systems for this purpose, showing that auditory feedback of the cardiovascular activity can support HR as connection in a remote setting where greater physical distances actually improved the feeling of connectedness, by which \textit{"participants suggested that less context was better"}. With HR as information on the other hand, \textit{"participants consistently said that there was a need for context in order for the HR to be informative"}. Regarding this methodology, we note that a crucial dependency of the bonding experience and comfort lies within the pre-existing relationship between users, implying that this manner of HR sharing becomes less viable when situated between between strangers. Similar works have considered the willingness of exposing private physiological information such as heart rate (e.g. \cite{walmink_displaying_2013}). Confronting such challenges that come with public space interventions, \citeauthor{howell_life-affirming_2019}'s study into sharing heart sounds explores the convergence between intimacy and anonymity in a way that encourages a co-present affirmation during momentary encounters \cite{howell_life-affirming_2019}.

Examples of shared biofeedback have been documented using other input and output modalities, such as skin conductance (EDA) and respiration being combined with light, visuals, and haptic forms of feedback \cite{frey_breeze_2018,howell_biosignals_2016,ashford_eeg_2019}. Among various configurations, these case studies are aligned towards an interpersonal awareness of emotional states, without the need to define them literally. While these research outcomes bring affirmation into fostering social connectedness, we take into account use-cases for which subjects are able to to convey contextual information from embodied sensor data. For example, inferring emotional traits from visual representations of another user's heart rate when supplemented with the events of a board game \cite{frey_remote_2016}. During gameplay, participants associated changes in other player's heart rate with bluffing, being upset, stress and even happiness.

\section{Wearables in Creative Practice}
\label{lit_review:biosignals_creativity}

The integration of biosignals in creative practive, artistic performance in particular provides motivation to present physiological activity in creative ways for which an audience can empathise with the performer while they are being exposed to their inner state, as explained by \citeauthor{francoise_designing_2017} \cite{francoise_designing_2017}. We review some examples that achieve this by utilising the aesthetic value of physiological sensor data to convey sort of emotional meaning. While experiencing a performance, and the audience is engaged, the performer-audience relationship becomes a collaborative process, taking upon the \textit{beholder's involvement}, asserting that it's the role of perceiver is to create meaning \cite{kandel_age_2012}.

An example of presenting bodily data as performative artefact is the appropriation of physiological sensors by musicians to generate sound \cite{aly_appropriating_2021}.
\textbif{examples of instrumetns}
This work is commonly observed under the NIME community, where the given systems are to be interpreted as musical instruments, and user can develop virtuous control through practice. A recent review by \citeauthor{giomi_somatic_2020}, provides insights into somatic sonification approaches. While continuing to work with sound-based interactions, these are more suitable to dance performances, where by the user is performing with their body on stage, and the system is used to better communicate their experience, though motor actions can also be influeced by sound in this context.

Different types of inputs can be used to obtain the respective dance data sets. Alaoui and colleagues \cite{fdili2017seeing} for example distinguish among (i) positional data which are retrieved by employing motion capture systems; (ii) movement dynamics (such as acceleration/deceleration), which are recorded by means of inertial sensors; and (iii) physiological information, which can be obtained from biosignal sensor technologies.

One relevant example is the work of Mark Coniglio with MidiDancer (1989), a software that allowed a performer to control music \cite{Troikaranch}. A more recent example is the work of Frieder Weiss with the system EyeCon (2004), which allows movement to control several aspects of a performance \cite{wechsler2004eyecon}. Dance artists, researchers and educators have been extensively exploring interactive digital technologies in workshop and rehearsal situations \cite{dinkla2002dance}, and in public performances and installations \cite{latulipe2010exploring}.

Zhou et al. have recently conducted a systematic review of the past twenty years of dance literature in HCI \cite{zhou_dance_2021}. They identified four main categories of technological approaches: Physiological Sensing; Multisensory Perception; Movement Quality; and Agent Collaboration. Fdili Alaoui et at. created a methodology to combine multimodal capture with recognition of Laban Effort qualities \cite{fdili_alaoui_seeing_2017}. They distinguished among different approaches to collect information from the body: Positional data retrieved by motion capture; Movement dynamics recorded by inertial sensors; and Physiological information obtained from biosignal sensors. Rostami et al. \cite{rostami_bio-sensed_2017} created five design concepts for interactive performance adopting bio-sensing and bodily tracking technologies. Aly et al. conducted a review of biosensor modalities for performance with an HCI perspective, which discusses the affordances of muscular activity to depict rich movement information \cite{aly_appropriating_2021}.

The following the state-of-the-art review points to a number of use-cases that incorporate contemporary machine learning methods. To summarize these motives, we can assume a mutual view by which the output of the machine learning system is considered to play a part of the performance, which can achieved through audiovisual augmentation that compliments the movement, or even more literally in the form of an artificial agent that performs on stage.

\subsection{Therapeutic Qualities of Artistic Creation}

As we consider the function of aesthetics in representing one's physiological activity, we are able to proceed with our underlying research goal of supporting non-verbal communication strategies. Highlight the relevance of non-verbal communication in therapeutic settings, so in addition to performance contexts, we are also interested in arts-therapy practices, which also rely on aesthetic engagement.

In the following article entitled, \textit{"The Aesthetic Turn in Mental Health"}, \citeauthor{samaritter_aesthetic_2018} assess the potential benefits music therapy and dance movement therapy can have on one's mental well-being, recognising the sensory-expressive experience of the maker as oppose to an audience \cite{samaritter_aesthetic_2018}. Five core themes are derived from a literature review and comments taken from experts in the field, which are briefly as follows: requiring embodied presence, to apply the senses kinesthetically and musically; somatic resources, supporting anatomical, visceral and neuropsychological functioning; articulation and expression of emotional contentl; sensitivity to non-verbal communication, and enactive empathy; The non-verbal or pre-verbal character of aesthetics to support diversity and cross-cultural interaction.

Amongst these themes, considered harmonous with our research goals, we can interpret that in these scenareos, that collective sense making can be considered part of the experierience. Here, we can make a connection between \citeauthor{gaver_drift_2004}'s' Ludic Design principles \cite{gaver_drift_2004} with the function of \textit{``enactive engagement''} that encourages particpants to experiment freely with new possibilities.

The article also establishes the essential role of an experienced somatic practictionaer that is given the responsability of guiding these sessions in a safe and constructive manner. \textit{Somatic connoisseurship} is granted to those that hold a comprehensive training and experience in one or more relevant body-centred practices, which certifies the appropriate facilitation of such activities to somatic laypersons \cite{samaritter_aesthetic_2018}.

% \begin{itemize}
% \item Arts support and require embodied presence
% \item Arts-therapy appeal to somatic resources, supporting anatomical, visceral and neuropsychological functioning
% \item Arts support articulation and expression of emotional content.
% \item Arts support sensitivity to non-verbal communication between participants. Furthermore, enactive empathy can be considered a core aspect arts-therapy practices.
% \item The non-verbal or pre-verbal character of aesthetics was considered to support diversity and cross-cultural interaction
% \end{itemize}

\section{Aesthetics and Abstract Representation}
\label{lit_review:abstract}

In the previous chapter, we form an understanding of the aesthetic domain in context of the thesis research, pointing towards the acceptability of abstract representations in communication, unbounded to specified linguistic descriptors. This is to accept that if something is cultivated out of their personal life experiences, it is inherently ambiguous \cite{kaplan_esthetic_1948}. The overall objective with this is to open up to an individualistic presentation and perception of foreign live biofeedback \cite{lux_live_2018}, that in our case, are driven by wearable sensors. In light of this, we take note of how abstraction is being routinely practised in the arts, playing a major role in describing established systems of contemporary art. For instance, abstract expressionism implies that personal and emotional structures are isolated and emphasised against ambiguous forms \cite{pollock_action_2008}.

\subsection{In Modernism}

\citeauthor{kandel_two_2013} ties relevance to the concept of the beholder's share to a biological view of the human mind \cite{kandel_two_2013}, focusing on a specific period of art history, comparing two approaches presented by Alois Riegl and Sigmund Freud. Where the former is focused more on the artist's developmental psychology \cite{freud_leonardo_1999}, the article highlights the importance of aesthetic reception, suggesting that art is incomplete without the perceptual and emotional involvement of the viewer \cite{riegl_group_1999}. This follows into the notion identified as the \textit{beholder's share} (previously named the beholder's involvement), in which the perceiver unconsciously assigns their own meaning to the non-representation in accordance to their previous life experiences, stimulating an emotional dialogue. This understanding of a viewer's perception gives way to the ambiguous nature of individual expression, on the account that \textit{"when an artist produces a powerful image out of his own life experiences, the image is inherently ambiguous"}.

\subsection{In Psychology}

The following essay compares the mental processes that occur between perceiving artistic images, citing studies fMRI based studies that show distinctive patterns in the subject's neural activity between representational or abstract forms \cite{aviv_what_2014}. More recently, this perceptual comparison has been studied to understand how abstract art can evoke feelings of psychological distance, hypothesised to help withstand situations of interpersonal and social distancing \cite{durkin_objective_2020}, drawing parallels with Riegl's theory of subjective experience. The authors develop a strong case for adopting abstract representations in supporting one's mental well-being in the long term. Essentially stating that, by exposing users to abstract representations, it's possible that they become more accustom to sensing undefinable feelings in their everyday lives \cite{durkin_objective_2020}.

% In parallel, we are taking insight from the non-classical view of emotion derived from Lisa Feldman Barrett's Research. Both of these concepts highlight the role of the perceiver to induce meaningful inference.

% was further explored by art historians Ernst Kris and E.H. Gombrich,
\subsection{In Design}

The expressive utility of abstract representation has been taken fondly by interaction design practices, notably rooted in the seminal writings of \citeauthor{gaver_ambiguity_2003} that describes finite interpretation as a limitation in data-driven digital technologies, leverging aspects from design practice into HCI \cite{gaver_ambiguity_2003}. In a subsequent interview based around these ideas, a call for ambiguity in design is firmly articulated by Gaver, given that \textit{"we don’t need systems telling us how to live and what to do."}, thus favouring an aesthetic appreciation that allows us to \textit{"find out own ways of leading meaningful lives"} \cite{gaver_gaffney_2007}. Ambiguity as a resource has since been embraced as part of several HCI research efforts, serving as a key contribution to a non-reductionist, non-informational view on emotionally-informed technology \cite{sanches_ambiguity_2019,howell_biosignals_2016,stahl_evocative_2014}. These principles are complimented in \citeauthor{gaver_drift_2004}'s \textit{ludic design} \cite{gaver_drift_2004}, while granting openness to interpretation, is also directed towards encouraging curiosity and curiosity of an interactive artefact, lending authority to the user to curate their own experience of it. This later made its way into case-studies advocating for creative participation, in a variety of contexts, including that of architecture and musical instrument design \cite{harriss_ludic_2010,mcpherson_designing_2016}.

% With an alternative approach in mind, we can start to move away from goal-oriented emotion detection tasks and instead, prepare experiences that subtly adapt the user's cognitive behaviours over time.

\section{Affective Computing: Inferring Emotional states from Physiological Data}
\label{alit_review:affective_computing}

In this section, we will summarise the common practices found in Affective Computing research over the past two decades and how this has evolved to the current state-of-the-art. The methods discussed in the following section are used as a reference to the typical assumptions adopted in the field, as for the rest of the thesis, we will be receptive to alternative views for designing emotionally informed systems, leveraging principles embraced by \citeauthor{hook_interactional_2008} \cite{hook_interactional_2008}, \citeauthor{barrett_functionalism_2017} \cite{barrett_functionalism_2017} and others cited throughout.

Given an intriguing appeal for developing emotionally-informed relationships between humans and machines, the attention here is directed specifically to the physiological constructs of emotion and the appropriation of wearable sensors. The theoretical validation of which being partly derivative to the theories of emotions put fourth by William James and Carl Lange, claiming that emotions are the result of bodily changes triggered by external stimuli \cite{james_principles_1890,cannon_james-lange_1927}. Many have come out to challenge these ideas, with more advanced perspectives openly being addressed in Picard's original report, complimenting the inherent complexities and open-debate around the subject of emotional technologies.

\textbf{give examples!}
Among these, the informational outlook of emotion adopted in these examples has since been contrasted with the interactional approach used emphasise the social aspects of emotions.

The interactional approach asserts that though emotion has biophysical aspects, it is dynamically experienced and appreciates \textit{"emotion as a social and cultural product experienced through our interactions"}. Here is room for an affective computing that does not look at the body as \textit{“an instrument or object for the mind, passively receiving sign and signals, but not actively being part of producing them”}, as phrased by \citeauthor{hook_kristina_affective_2012} when referring to dominant paradigms in commercial sports applications \cite{hook_kristina_affective_2012}. However, how to best address bodily movement and engagement beyond measuring cues and signals is unclear. Most studies in affective computing revolve around affect recognition from emotion detection and bodily data classification \cite{bota_review_2019}. Research in this field commonly revolves around the detection of four basic emotions: fear, anger, sadness, and joy \cite{picard_mit_nodate}. Such alternatives can alleviate from the function of mapping discrete emotions into a statistical model bound to universal interpretation, but rather let humans make sense of each other's expressions in subjective ways, ambiguous and contextually adaptive.

% \begin{center}
% \begin{tabular}{|p{13cm}}
% \textbf{Cognitivist vs. interactional approaches}

% In contrast, the interactional approach seeks to help "people to understand and experience their own emotions" and to improve computer-mediated interpersonal communication.


% Picard's critics describe her concept of emotion as "objective, internal, private, and mechanistic". They say it reduces emotion to a discrete psychological signal occurring inside the body that can be measured and which is an input to cognition, undercutting the complexity of emotional experience.

To summarise, we consider that the interactional view supports the theoretical grounds for communication strategies with wearable sensors by welcoming aesthetic representation and henceforth, ambiguity. This leads us to broadening the proposed affective loop framework (proposed in \cite{hook_affective_2009}) by engaging multiple subjects simultaneously, inclusive of third-person perspectives, supporting empathy, communication, and joint acts of perception to transpire \cite{turmo_vidal_designing_2021,francoise_designing_2017}.

\subsection{Measuring Affect in Social Contexts}
\label{lit_reivew:ssp}

% Social siganls
In face-to-face interactions, subjects make use of \textit{"Body Language"} as a form non-verbal communication, assuming actions such as gaze, gestures, posture and navigation of interpersonal space \cite{dobre_immersive_2022}. Psychology literature admits to the limited ability we have as humans to interpret non-verbal behaviours during social interactions \cite{joseph_emotional_2010}. However, by recognising a coordination with emotions and physiological changes \cite{mayer_human_2008}, we can consider sensory interventions as a means to help convey and interpret social cues emitted from other people.

In the interest of bridging two prominent topics that are aligned with our research goals, we give attention to an article by Chanel and Mühl \cite{chanel_connecting_2015} which surveys the use of physiological data to facilitate affective non-verbal communication, combining concepts from Affective Computing and Social Signal Processing. The authors acknowledge the case for traditional emotion recognition tasks and explain that physiological activity can also be related to several social processes, such as empathy \cite{levenson_empathy_1992}. It's also explained how activity from the central nervous system correlates to affective and cognitive states during social interaction, where social emotions include shame, embarrassment, gratitude and admiration. These physiological changes are considered for the most part involuntary and therefore hold little to no bias.

Despite knowing that there's a strong correlation between physiological data with affect, authors identify a lack of studies directed towards social interaction, and the most studied non-verbal modalities are in fact facial expressions and tone for voice. This can be partially justified given that in conventional social situations, thees internal signals aren't so easily perceived \cite{vinciarelli_social_2009}. On this persuasion, two research directions are proposed, the first is to display social cues to foreign users through physiological data, The second involves analysing physiological activity among multiple users to facilitate collective interaction. The latter approach compliments \citeauthor{slovak_understanding_2012}'s proposal for \textit{composite signals} for HR as information (i.e., combining physiological signals from different people together) \cite{slovak_understanding_2012}.

% \textit{Connecting Brains and Bodies: Applying Physiological Computing to Support Social Interaction}
% Physiological activity can be defined as a social cue, it can convey information about one's emotional state whilst it is not the primary function. For example, blushing as a result of high blood pressure.

% There are only a few systems that utilise physiological signals to preform social inferences, aside from those from Affective Computing research dedicated to emotional assessment.

%  These physiological changes from our autonomic nervous system can be considered highly reliable as the y are very difficult to control and mostly involuntary.

\section{The Embodiment of Emotions, Self-Report Strategies}
% \textcolor{red}{another title?}

Self-reports are often considered a necessary resource in studies of psychology and mental wellbeing, suitably transferable to Affective Computing also. Generally speaking, this serves as an assessment into the subject's cognition, emotion, motivation, behaviour, or physical state, accepted as a personal judgement. Such reports can emerge in many different forms, questionnaires and interview transcripts are commonplace, but not inclusive \cite{barker_self-report_2016}. Taking the understanding of embodied emotions described in Section \ref{background:ebodiment_emotions}, we highlight existing methods of reporting that comply with non-verbal modes of expression, specifically those linked to bodily attributes.

\subsection{The Self-Assessment Manikin}

The Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) has proven to be a successful method of prescribing emotional responses to a set of pictorial representations, pre-arranged to visualise 5-point scales of valence, arousal and dominance, thus considered highly compatible within the scope of Affective Computing research \cite{zeigler-hill_self-assessment_2017}. The method was introduced as a way of overcoming the semantic dependencies in traditional self-reporting which carry major limitations related to the tedious data organisation required and being poorly adaptable between different languages \cite{zeigler-hill_self-assessment_2017}. However, Where Self-Assessment Manikins provide an effective way of capturing emotional states related to a specific object or event, there remains lacking feasibility for representing traits relating to one´s habitual patterns of emotion.

\subsection{Body Maps}
\textcolor{red}{too long? Can it be split somehow?}

The term ‘body mapping’ is defined as the process of creating body maps (human body images) \textit{"to visually represent aspects of people's lives, their bodies and the world they live in”} \cite{gastaldo_body-map_2012}. This term has been used for health contexts (e.g. HIV/AIDS) in the last two decades and also in the context of occupational health and safety for almost 50 years \cite{gastaldo_body-map_2012}. \citeauthor{de_jager_embodied_2016} conducted a systematic review of body mapping, identifying several attributes, such as social justice, community development tool, planning and psychological assessment \cite{de_jager_embodied_2016}. The body maps Gastaldo et al. presented in their research are free-form and unconstrained, there is no predefined structure (such as a preexisting body outline) and include contextual elements such as annotations. A more constrained body map, with an outline of the human body, is used by Windlin et al. \cite{windlin_soma_2019}, to reflect on experiences through drawings and notes: \textit{“these maps became a rich source of data for first-person perspectives of bodily experiences and sensations”}. For the body maps, the authors adapted an earlier body outline from Loke et al. \cite{loke_bodily_2012}. A similar body map has been used in related soma design research, for example by Höök et al. \cite{hook_soma_2019} and Tsaknaki et al. \cite{tsaknaki_teaching_2019}.
% Núñez-Pacheco and Loke introduced the concept of felt-sensing -- inner exploration of bodily feeling -- using body maps \cite{nunez-pacheco_felt-sensing_2016}. Núñez-Pacheco proposed “the use of tangible materials as a way to articulate experience from the inner self”, also employing body maps \cite{nunez-pacheco_tangible_2021}.

% In a scenario closer to the artistic research herein presented, Loke and Khut \cite{loke_intimate_2014} developed an art exhibition using “interactive heart rate controlled audio-visuals with audience participation”. They used body maps as a means for audience members to describe “sensations and images they experienced within and around their body, during the interaction” \cite{loke_intimate_2014}.

We would like to suggest here, that these representations become more difficult to interpret from one person to another as they are used to document more abstract sensations in the body. When considering that, for instance, two persons may be highlighting the same areas, producing illustrations that look very much alike while trying to describe experience that are entirely different from one another (and visa versa). Unlike the self-assessment manikin, there is no definitive emotional inference to be made from an individual bodily drawing, this is formed by a process of interpretation when presented alongside supplementary information. This may be presented as first person descriptions, visual annotations \cite{windlin_soma_2019}, video recordings (demonstrated in Section \ref{preliminary_actions:modi_ws1}), or taken together with additional body maps, revealing generalisable patterns amongst them. %\cite{nummenmaa_bodily_2014}.
Nummenmaa et al. conducted a study where over 700 participants we asked to colour body map regions according to various emotional stimuli \cite{nummenmaa_bodily_2014}. By layering these visual impressions, it was possible to observe \textit{"net sensations"}, this being the collective agreement towards the bodily regions being activated when subjected to a particular emotional cue. For example, “anger” in the hands or the whole body in “happiness” \cite{davey_where_2021}. Taking inspiration from this, \citeauthor{schino_applying_2021} exemplify how body mapping exercises enabled participants to report complex emotions that were elicited by new media artworks \cite{schino_applying_2021}.

%  \subsubsection{Limitation of Body Maps in HCI}
 Recent literature on soma design has aimed to overcome the temporal limitations of body maps, as “they exist as a snapshot or state representation” \cite{tennent_articulating_2021}. To solve this limitation, Tennent et al. propose the concept of “soma trajectories”: “how a user feels through an interaction, both in body and mind” \cite{tennent_articulating_2021}. In Sections \ref{case_studies:latent_steps} and \ref{case_studies:modi_dis}, we further detail what we perceive as major limitations of body mapping strategies and investigate upon ways of overcoming them.

\subsection{Physiological Responses}
%  Sensor data as a report
A recent survey describes how affective physiological measures alone can subside the use of traditional self-reporting procedures \cite{barker_self-report_2016}. However, much of this work is geared towards consumer appeal and advertising, settling for basic uni-dimensional forms of emotional measure. \citeauthor{ciuk_measuring_2015} explicitly opens up such limitations given the context of gauging political attitudes, where physiological measures fall short in comparison to self-reports when accounting for emotional nuances \cite{ciuk_measuring_2015}. To our knowledge, studies that combine physiological data with visual self-reporting are hard to come by. One example that sucessfully correlates these two forms of assessment was carried out by \citeauthor{} seeks to understand how emotional states can be influecned by one's awareness to their internal bodily states (e.g. heart-rate) \cite{}.

Concluding from all of this, we are far more interested in adopting a multimoal approach where sensor data is rather used to organise and navigate between user-reported states, not acting as the inference itself.

\section{Concluding Remarks \& Design Principles}
\label{lit_review:conclusion}

In this work, we aim to develop and evaluate methods of sharing physiological activity this is abstracted from raw signals and without explicit associations to linguistic descriptors. Through visual, auditory and tactile feedback, we intend to generate new representations of the subject's inner state inferred from analysing physiological signals, which can then be transmitted to foreign users as a means of communication. In review of the studies referenced above, we embrace non-representations and aesthetics that can engage the brain in new ways, developing new cognitive and emotional associations.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{Chapters/Figures/Abstracted_Representations.png}
	\caption{Types of Outputs for Representing Physiological Activity}
	\label{fig:Abstracted_Representations}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:Abstracted_Representations}, we show a simplified plot of how physiological activity can be presented either before or after inference. The leftmost end of the spectrum leans towards the ideas discussed in section \ref{lit_review:biosignals_sharing}, where live biofeedback depicts the low-level features of the signal. The rightmost end of the spectrum describes what is achieved in cognitive-based emotion recognition systems, where the data is computationally analysed to produce emotional inferences for the user, manifested as a high-level descriptors (e.g fear, joy, surprise, etc...). We intend to demonstrate of middle-ground, for which it's not neccessary to determine a particular socio-affective inference, nor intended to display . To achieve this, we take inspiration from performative uses of embodied sensor data, introduced in section \ref{lit_review:biosignals_creativity}, enabling features of the signal to generate abstract representation, to be perceived by a foreign body.
% In this case, it's expected for the external user to make socio-affective inferences from the abstracted representation.

Deviating from the methods surveyed in this section, we would like to use this research opportunity to delve into the affordances of contemporary machine learning techniques as a means of generating new representations of biosensor data. We consider this initiative to be a novel contribution to the field given the impression that machine learning systems are commonly purposed to derive high-level emotional descriptions for emotion recognition tasks. To stay persistent with the thesis objectives, these generative representations should align with the interactional perspective in regards to the non-reductionist principles summarized in section x.x. The aim is not to detect a singular 'right' or 'true' emotion, but rather, to inspire expressive dialogue and emotional reflection \cite{hook_affective_2009}. Our incentive for adopting non-representational machine learning solutions in this context is to exhaust the output possibilities when mapping decoded sensor data of relatively low dimensionality, and embracing high-granularity results that can expose expressive nuances that may not be so salient in the raw data alone.

% burrowing something pre-exsitsing to describe something conceptual \cite{lakoff_metaphors_2003}

% In addition, we would like to study upon the idea that machine learning systems can improve the level of personalization in affective interactive systems compared to what is normally expected.

In summary, we offer the following design principles that will be adopted into practical assessment: Communication mediums should not infer emotional states that hold a predetermined meaning; physiological sensor data elicits feedback, however the content of which should not directly mirror the raw biological functions that correspond; Users are granted the responsibility to explore the affordances of a system according their bodies and interpret the representations that are produced in that process; Sensor data alone is not a sufficient means of expression, rather considered a way of navigating the aesthetic functions informed by the user and their surroundings.

% Due to the ambiguity of the feedback, the authors found that the device often led to conversations about the wearer’s feelings. Generally, when providing ambient or wearable live biofeedback for social interaction, one  needs to consider users’ willingness to share their private physiological information

% Given the ambient nature of these interventions, designers should consider how one is exposing their private physiological information
