\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:objectives}

In the process of any given interaction, humans will naturally reveal a vast arrangement of emotional signals through bodily functions independent from speech. Physical traits such as posture, gait and eye-contact come under the social phenomenon known as Non-verbal behaviours. Other non-verbal cues commonly studied in the literature include facial expressions and tone of voice \cite{carton_nonverbal_1999}, assuming a kind of social cue that's observable during a conventional human-human exchange when given deliberate attention. However, we should also take into account the changes that take place inside of the body, being those not so easily perceived without way of technological intervention.

Affective Computing, and specifically the combination of physiological sensing and cognitive frameworks has been established for over two decades \cite{picard_affective_2000}, securing prospects for developing emotionally-informed systems. A significant progression in this field can be conclusive of using state-of-the-art Machine Learning (and Deep Learning) methods to interpret large-scale datasets, achieving honourable breakthroughs in view of emotion recognition studies \cite{bota_review_2019}. Such systems tend to operate according to linguistic descriptors of universal emotions. We recognise however, that these discrete representations become less meaningful when perceived in lack of contextual information. An emerging area of research considers the role of interactive systems for sharing of physiological activity between it´s users, enhancing connectedness by way of anatomical transparency \cite{lux_live_2018}. The resulting artefacts tend to utilise raw forms of data representation, disregarding emotional interpretation. Simultaneously, embodied sensor technology has been incorporated in to creative practices, commonly as a means to capture emotional qualities of bodily gestures during performance, and then being able to transmit this information to a third-person perspective \cite{fdili_alaoui_seeing_2017}. 

Aesthetic representations have been incorporated into a wide range of user-centred technologies, observed by the broader vision of third-wave Human-Computer Interaction, through the comprehension that aesthetics are not bound to formal artistic creation, but an essential function of sensorial engagement \cite{bodker2015third}. To which degree, novel systems have been capable of capturing and mediating the emotional experiences that present themselves in everyday life \cite{schiphorst_designing_2020}.

We identify a motivation and methodology for using wearable sensors as an expressive resource for speechless dialogue, putting aesthetics at the forefront of interaction. Initialised from a thorough discussion on state-of-the art technologies and established design principles regarding this topic, then applied to a novel approach alongside a selection of practice works to compliment this. Given the preliminary proposition of non-representation, the intention is not to infer or classify emotion, but rather create new opportunities for rich gestural exchange, unconfined to the verbal domain. Embracing the right to express oneself from the within, taking the heart, lungs, muscles and motor activity as a basis for maintaining expressive speechless dialogue through the act of being present with the self, others and social environment.

\section{Core Research Questions}
\label{sec:research_questions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Why} should embodied sensor technologies be used to mediate speechless dialogue?
    \item \textbf{What} mediums are capable of producing emotionally meaningful representations of physiological signals, suitable for social intervention?
    \item \textbf{How. } Adopting methods from modern Machine Learning and New Media practices, \textbf{how} can aesthetics be incorporated into visuals, sound and haptic mechanisms to articulate and express emotional content? And \textbf{how} do we encourage user empowerment and penalisation for effective intervention?  
    
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{1. Why.} Given the layers of novelty and interdisciplinary nature of our work, weaving between the domains of data science, psychology, performance and interaction design, we commit to delivering a comprehensive review of relevant research actions presented in the state-of-the-art, and clearly validate our appropriation of such technologies and practices.

\textbf{2. What.} Part of our research is also devoted to evaluating specific technologies that can be used. Starting from the common wearable sensing modalities, reviewing the interactive affordances of each, along with their corresponding feature extraction methods to retrieve emotionally relevant information. We evaluate methods for producing noel representations and the appropriate mediums for transmitting this between users, whether that be through sound, visual or hardware-based interaction, in a way that balances aesthetic and informational qualities.

\textbf{3. How.} By adopting user-centred principles from third-wave HCI research, already demonstrating success in these areas, we aim to push more towards technical transparency, in that the user is really a part of the design process and consequentially, feel a sense of authority over the system. This assumes a level of responsibility towards proactive sense making, by way of parameter adjustment, personal contributions to datasets. and voluntary participation.

\section{Thesis Structure}
\label{sec:structure}

\subsection{Chapter 1: Introduction}
The current section briefly sets out the underlying motivation and raises major research questions that run consistent throughout the thesis research.

\subsection{Chapter 2: Theoretical and Technical Concepts}

Chapter \ref{cha:technical_concepts} provides a background to the technical and theoretical concepts that form the foundation of thesis. To begin, we divide the proposed title into four constructs: Non-verbal Communication; Physiological Sensors; The Aesthetic Domain; and Neural Networks. This is used to establish the major themes of the research and introduce conceptual bridges therein. From a technical standpoint, we provide a primer on the different physiological signals commonly used in the corresponding literature, noting their relevance and usability when applied in a given experimental context. We also take the opportunity to introduce some common practices used in relevant research fields such as Gesture Analysis, Social Signal Processing and the philosophical underpinning of Somaesthetics.

Advancing from various of topics grounded in computing and psychology research, we start to uncover a firm basis for aesthetic evaluation in context of technological intervention as social-affective mediation

\subsection{Chapter 3: Literature Review}

In Chapter \ref{cha:lit_review}, we comment on some relevant literature covering the following key topics of interest, first looking at established research fields, namely, Affective Computing, Social Signal Processing, Interactive Machine Learning, Somaesthetic Design, and Non-Representational Theory, then to cover the broad domains of biosignals in creative practice, new media and performance, sensor-based communication strategies and recognised methods for emotional representation. After presenting an overview of a diverse range of topics and research outcomes, we articulate pick out relevant component to cultivate overall perspectives, justifying the intersection of these topics and identifying design principles that adopted the research actions as described throughout the chapters that follow.

e divide the research topics into the following areas, namely: the social impact of sharing physiological activity in human-human interactions, the appropriation of biosignals in creative practice and performance contexts, and methods for inferring emotional states from physiological data.

\subsection{Chapter 4: Technical Preparations}

In Chapter \ref{cha:technical_contributions}, we will introduce and examine a set of hardware and software tools that were developed within the duration of the PhD and adopted for the purposes of augmenting collaborative sensor-based interactions. This will include the design of specialised wearable devices for physiological data sensing in the wild, temperaments for latency estimation, and systems for processing and preparing sensor data for various interactive environments. An underlying aim here is to utilise web-based data transmission protocols to be able to deploy interactive systems in a portable and spontaneous fashion, incentives towards studies to take place "in the wild".

\subsection{Chapter 5: Preliminary Actions}

Our Preliminary Actions \ref{cha:Preliminary_Actions} are initiated with an individualistic exploration of input-output mediums for physiological representation, forming a broad foundation of aesthetic affordances when testing with our own bodies. Transitioning from an introspective experience, we prepare engagements with a selection of specialist user-groups deemed suitable for providing new insights in a series of workshops that are comprised of focus group, data collection, ideation and evaluation stages.

\subsection{Chapter 6: Major Case Studies}

This will be followed by a collection of case studies that were realised using the knowledge organised from the prior research actions. In Chapter \ref{cha:case_studies}. We will present a set of experimental systems developed during the PhD, each intended to establish a theoretical framework for designing systems for emotional exchange. Given this experimental methodology, a matured research space should provoke and sustain discussions around the socio-political implications of technological interventions and appropriation in preparation to be deployed in out-of-lab environments, eventually gearing towards pervasive engagement.

\subsection{Chapter 7: Results and Discussion}

Finally, we are able to reflect on a multi-layered research process and consolidate the overall outcomes that are rooted in the essential research appeal of the thesis. These are ultimately formulated as aesthetic considerations when designing for sensation, representation and communication in context of sensory intervention. In Chapter \ref{cha:conclusion} We open up to some the major limitations present in our work, disclosing the additional paths for investigation that remain unfulfilled, closing the thesis with a call for future work in the push towards aesthetic engagement with communication technologies.
