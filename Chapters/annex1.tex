\chapter{Annex 1 Configuring R-IoT}
\label{ann:riot_opensignals}

The screenshots below overview the configuration steps required to stream data between the R-IoT device and host computer over a local WiFi network. As part of our technical preparations described in Section \ref{technical_contributions:severbit}, we developed a middleware program to simplify this process. These are specifically directed to the OpenSignals software package, though the general procedure may applied to other applications also.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Power on the device. Connect to the local WiFi network assigned to the R-IoT Configuration
    \item Change the IP address to static/manual and alter according to the R-IoTâ€™s destination address. Launch OpenSignals
    \item Go to Device Finder, enter the address and port into the text box: 192.168.1.100:8888 (default). Submit
    \item Enable device and select the required channels. Go to signal acquisition (record button)
\end{enumerate}
